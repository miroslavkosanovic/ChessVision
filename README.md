# ChessVision
A bot created using computer vision in order to interpret the board given on the screen and play the best move


The Chess Vision Bot uses computer vision to detect a 2D chessboard on the screen. It detects played moves by the opponent and calculates the best response given a certain time to calculate. The Chess Vision Bot is then able to move the mouse and execute the calculated move.
Thanks to the Stockfish-Engine it is able to play at a very high rating with quick movetimes.
Do not use this chessbot to play against a real human!
